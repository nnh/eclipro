        The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials
        will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.
        Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be obtained before any participant
        is enrolled.
        Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IRB before the changes
        are implemented to the study.
        In addition, all changes to the consent form will be IRB-approved; a determination will be

        consent, using a previously approved consent form.

        will take place without prior agreement from the Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational
        Device Exemption (IDE) sponsor, funding agency and documented approval from the Institutional
        Review Board (IRB), except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the trial
