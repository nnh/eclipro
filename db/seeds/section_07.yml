      <p><em>Participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study or the PI may discontinue a participant
      from the study.&nbsp; This section should state which adverse events would result in discontinuation
      of study intervention or participant discontinuation/withdrawal. In addition, participants may discontinue
      the study intervention, but remain in the study for follow-up, especially for safety and efficacy study
      endpoints (if applicable). Consider requiring separate documentation for study intervention discontinuation
      and participant discontinuation/withdrawal from the study. In addition, a dedicated Case Report Form
      (CRF) page should capture the date and the specific underlying reason for discontinuation of study
      intervention or participant discontinuation/withdrawal.</em></p>

    instructions: |-
      <p><em>Describe the criteria for discontinuing the study intervention (e.g., halting rules), including
      any monitoring test(s) and associated clinical decision point(s). Include reasons for temporary discontinuation
      of the study intervention (e.g., type and quantity of adverse events), clearly stating the length of time,
      if applicable, and describe the data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation
      and approaches for restarting administration of or rechallenging with study intervention. &nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Describe efforts that will be made to continue follow-up of participants who discontinue the
      study intervention, but remain in the study for follow-up, especially for safety and efficacy study
      endpoints (if applicable).&nbsp; Reasonable efforts must be made to undertake protocol-specified safety
      follow-up procedures to capture adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and unanticipated problems (UPs).</em></p>
    example: |-
      <p>Discontinuation from <span>[study intervention]</span> does not mean discontinuation from the study,
      and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by the study protocol.&nbsp; If a
      clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline)
      after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant
      management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><span>[Describe the procedures and data to be collected, as well as any follow-up evaluations]</span></li>

    title: Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study
    template_name: General
    template: ''
    instructions: |-
      <p><em>Provide a list of reasons participation may be discontinued. It may be appropriate to provide
      distinct discontinuation criteria for participants and cohorts. If so, both sets of criteria should
      be listed separately and the distinction between the two must be stated clearly.&nbsp; Also, note that
      participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study or discontinue the study intervention at any time.&nbsp;
      But, investigators should seek to minimize participant discontinuation/withdrawal from study except for safety reasons.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>In studies of implantable devices, a discussion should be included of any pertinent information
      that will be provided to withdrawn or discontinued participants (e.g., whether and how the device can
      be removed, how to replace batteries, how to obtain replacement parts, who to contact).&nbsp; In addition,
      it is important to capture the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, as this may impact inclusion of
      participant data in the analysis of results (see <strong>Section 9, Statistical Analyses</strong>).</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>This section should include a discussion of replacement of participants who withdraw or
      discontinue early, if replacement is allowed.&nbsp; This section should not include a discussion
      of how these participants will be handled in the analysis of study data.&nbsp; This should be captured
      in the <strong>Section 9, Statistical Analyses. </strong></em></p>
    example: |-
      <p>Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.</p>
      <p>An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Pregnancy</li>
      <li>Significant study intervention non-compliance</li>
      <li>If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation
      occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant</li>
      <li>Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention</li>
      <li>If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized)
      that precludes further study participation</li>
      <li>Participant unable to receive <span>[study intervention]</span> for <span>[x days/weeks]</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the
      <span>[specify]</span> Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are
      randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.&nbsp; Subjects who sign the
      informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw,
      or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, <span>[will <em>or</em> will not]</span> be replaced.</p>

    title: Lost to Follow-Up
    template_name: General
    template: ''
    instructions: |-
      <p><em>The protocol should describe the nature and duration of study follow-up. Validity of the
      study is a potential issue when participants are lost to follow-up, as information that is important
      to the endpoint evaluation is then lost. Participants are considered lost to follow-up when they
      stop reporting to scheduled study visits and cannot be reached to complete all protocol-required
      study procedures. Describe the plans to minimize loss to follow-up and missing data.</em></p>
    example: |-
      <p>A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for
      <span>[specify number of visits]</span> scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The site will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit
      <span>[specify time frame]</span> and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the
      assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.</li>
      <li>Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every
      effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary,
      a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).
      These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record or study file.</li>
      <li>Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn
      from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.</li>
