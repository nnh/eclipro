      <p><em>The title should be easy to remember, recognizable by administrative support staff, and sufficiently
      different from other protocol titles to avoid confusion. Brevity with specificity and neutrality is the
      goal.&nbsp; If there is a “short title” (i.e., an abbreviation used to refer to the study title, include
      here and that can be used throughout this document in place of the full title).</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Sponsor means an individual or pharmaceutical or medical device company, governmental agency,
      academic institution, private organization, or other organization who takes responsibility for and
      initiates a clinical investigation. </em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>All versions should have a version number and a date. Use the international date format
      (day month year) and write out the month (e.g., 23 June 2015).</em></p>
