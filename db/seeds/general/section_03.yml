      <p><em>For purposes of registration and reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov, the terms Objectives
      and Endpoints as used in this template align with the terms Primary Purpose and Outcome Measures
      in ClinicalTrials.gov, respectively. Provide a description of the study objectives and endpoints,
      as well as a justification for selecting the particular endpoints, in the table format included below</em>
      .&nbsp;
      <em>This will provide clear articulation of how the selected primary and secondary endpoint(s) are linked
      to achieving the primary and secondary objectives and an explanation of why endpoint(s) were chosen.</em>
      <em>Data points collected in the study should support an objective or have a regulatory purpose.&nbsp;
      Therefore, careful consideration should be given prospectively to the amount of data needed to support
      the study’s objectives.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>An objective is the purpose for performing the study in terms of the scientific question
      to be answered. Express each objective as a statement of purpose (e.g., to assess, to determine,
      to compare, to evaluate) and include the general purpose (e.g., efficacy, effectiveness, safety)
      and/or specific purpose (e.g., dose-response, superiority to placebo, effect of an intervention
      on disease incidence, disease severity, or health behavior).</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>A study endpoint is a specific measurement or observation to assess the effect of the study
      variable (study intervention). Study endpoints should be prioritized and should correspond to the
      study objectives and hypotheses being tested. Give succinct, but precise definitions of the study
      endpoints used to address the study’s primary objective and secondary objectives (e.g., specific
      laboratory tests that define safety or efficacy, clinical assessments of disease status, assessments
      of psychological characteristics, patient reported outcomes, behaviors or health outcomes).&nbsp;
      Include the study visits or time points at which data will be recorded or samples will be obtained.&nbsp;
      Describe how endpoint(s) will be adjudicated, if applicable.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Primary and secondary endpoints should be adjusted for multiplicity. If a claim is sought
      for the secondary endpoints, the statistical plan for adjustment for multiplicity should be aligned
      with those objectives.&nbsp; </em></p>

      concluding that the study met its objective (e.g., “the study wins”). Often Phase 2 and 3 trials
      include primary objectives, and therefore primary endpoints, to demonstrate effectiveness.&nbsp;
      Generally, there should be just one primary endpoint that will provide a clinically relevant, valid,
      and reliable measure of the primary objective.&nbsp; Additional primary endpoints may require an
      adjustment to the sample size calculations and p-value threshold.&nbsp; However, this is not always

      safety and effectiveness.</em></p>

      effects on the disease or condition. It is recommended that the list of secondary endpoints be short,
      because the chance of demonstrating an effect on any secondary endpoint after appropriate correction
      for multiplicity becomes increasingly small as the number of endpoints increases.&nbsp;</em></p>
