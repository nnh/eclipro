      <p><em>No text is to be entered in this section; rather it should be included under the relevant subheadings below.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>The following subsections should include a description of the study population and participant
      recruitment. The study population should be appropriate for clinical trial phase and the development
      stage of the study intervention.&nbsp; Given the continuing challenges in achieving clinically relevant
      demographic inclusion in clinical trials, it is important to focus on clinically relevant potential
      participants at the earliest stages of protocol development.&nbsp; Therefore, it is essential that
      the population’s characteristics be considered during the trial planning phase to ensure the trial
      can adequately meet its objectives and provide evidence for the total population that will potentially
      utilize the study intervention under evaluation (e.g., elderly and pediatric populations, women, and minorities).</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Use the following guidelines when developing participant eligibility criteria to be listed
      in <strong>Sections 5.1 Inclusion Criteria and 5.2 Exclusion Criteria</strong>:</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>The eligibility criteria should provide a definition of participant characteristics required
      for study entry/enrollment.</em></li>
      <li><em>If participants require screening, distinguish between screening participants vs enrolling
      participants. Determine if screening procedures will be performed under a separate screening consent form.</em></li>
      <li><em>The risks of the study intervention should be considered in the development of the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria so that risks are minimized.</em></li>
      <li><em>The same criterion should not be listed as both an inclusion and exclusion criterion (e.g., do not
      state age &gt;18 years old as an inclusion criterion and age ≤18 years old as an exclusion criterion).</em></li>
      <li><em>Identify specific laboratory tests or clinical characteristics that will be used as criteria
      for enrollment or exclusion.</em></li>
      <li><em>If reproductive status (e.g., pregnancy, lactation, reproductive potential) is an eligibility
      criterion, provide specific contraception requirements (e.g., licensed hormonal or barrier methods).</em></li>
      <li><em>If you have more than one study population, please define the common inclusion and exclusion
      criteria followed by the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for each subpopulation.</em></li>

      <p><em>Inclusion criteria are characteristics that define the population under study, e.g., those
      criteria that every potential participant must satisfy, to qualify for study entry. Provide a statement
      that individuals must meet all of the inclusion criteria in order to be eligible to participate in the
      study and then list each criterion. Women and members of minority groups must be included in accordance
      with the NIH Policy on Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Participants In Research Involving Human Subjects.</em></p>

      <p><em>Some criteria to consider for inclusion are: provision of appropriate consent and assent,
      willingness and ability to participate in study procedures, age range, health status, specific clinical
      diagnosis or symptoms, background medical treatment, laboratory ranges, and use of appropriate contraception.
      Additional criteria should be included as appropriate for the study design and risk.</em></p>

      <li>Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the <span>[study intervention]</span> regimen</li>
      <li>For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at least 1 month
      prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study participation and for an additional
      <span>[specify duration]</span> weeks after the end of <span>[study intervention]</span> administration.</li>
      <li>For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure effective contraception with partner</li>

      from study participation and then list each criterion. &nbsp;If specific populations are excluded (e.g., elderly
      or pediatric populations, women or minorities), provide a clear and compelling rationale and justification,
      to establish that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the participants or the purpose
      of the research. Limited English proficiency cannot be an exclusion criterion.</em></p>

      <p><em>Participants who are consented to participate in the clinical trial, who do not meet one or

      A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen
      failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing
      requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes
      demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).</p>

      <li><em>How potential participants will be identified and approached</em></li>
      <li><em>Types of recruitment strategies planned (e.g. patient advocacy groups, national newspaper,
