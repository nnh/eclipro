      to be tested.&nbsp; In addition, consider inclusion of the following information:</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Describe whether identifiers will be attached to data/samples, or whether data will be coded or unlinked.</li>
      <li>If unlinked or coded, and additional information (e.g., age, ethnicity, sex, diagnosis) is available,
      discuss whether this might make specific individuals or families identifiable.</li>
      <li>If research data/samples will be coded, describe how access to the “key” for the code will be
      limited. Include description of security measures (password-protected database, locked drawer, other).&nbsp;
      List names or positions of persons with access to the key.</li>

      <li><em>Approaches to ensure privacy of study participants</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>For some studies, a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) may be necessary. A CoC provides
      protection to researchers and research institutions from being forced to provide identifying information
      on study participants to any federal, state or local authority. Authorization comes from NIH through
      section 301 (d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 (d)) which provides the Secretary of
      Health and Human Services the authority to protect the privacy of study participants. Refer to the
      NIH Certificate of Confidentiality Kiosk, for more details. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>10.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future Use of Stored Specimens and Data</h3>
      <p><em>If intended specimens or residual specimens are retained after the study is complete, include
      the provisions for consent and the options that are available for the participant to agree to the
      future use of his/her specimens, images, audio or video recordings. Specify the location(s), if other
      than the clinical site, where specimens or other data will be maintained, how long specimens or other
      data will be stored, if the site's IRB will review future studies, and protections of confidentiality
      for any future studies with the stored specimens or data (e.g., specimens will be coded, bar-coded,
      de-identified, identifying information will be redacted from audio recording transcripts). Include a
      statement that genetic testing will or will not be performed. </em></p>

      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>A</em><em> separate clinical monitoring plan (CMP) should describe in detail who will conduct
      the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will
      be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports.</em>&nbsp; <em>A CMP ordinarily should focus
      on preventing or mitigating important and likely risks, identified by a risk assessment, to critical
      data and processes. The types (e.g., on-site, centralized), frequency (e.g., early, for initial assessment
      and training versus throughout the study), and extent (e.g., comprehensive (100% data verification) versus
      targeted or random review of certain data (less than 100% data verification)) of monitoring activities
      will depend on a range of factors, considered during the risk assessment, including the complexity of
      the study design, types of study endpoints, clinical complexity of the study population, geography,
      relative experience of the PI and of the sponsor with the PI, electronic data capture, relative safety
      of the study intervention, stage of the study, and quantity of data.</em></p>

      <li><em>The documents to be reviewed (e.g., CRFs, clinic notes, product accountability records, specimen
      tracking logs, questionnaires, audio or video recordings), who is responsible, and the frequency for reviews. </em></li>
      <li><em>Who will be responsible for addressing QA issues (e.g., correcting procedures that are not in
      compliance with protocol) and QC issues (e.g., correcting errors in data entry). </em></li>
      <li><em>Staff training methods and how such training will be tracked.</em></li>
      <li><em>If applicable, calibration exercises conducted prior to and during the study to train examiners

      relevant data standards or common data elements that are being utilized as a part of the trial. Specify
      whether it will be paper or electronic, distributed or central, batched or ongoing processing, and any
      related requirements. Indicate expectations for time for submission of CRFs. Further details should be
      provided in the MOP or the data management plan, including detailed descriptions of source documentation,
      CRFs, instructions for completing forms, data handling procedures, and procedures for data monitoring.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other
      activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.&nbsp;
      Electronic source data are data initially recorded in electronic form. Examples of source data include,
      but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda,
      participants’ memory aids or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, audio recordings of
      counseling sessions, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after
      verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic
      media, x-rays, and participant files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico-technical
      departments involved in the clinical trial. It is acceptable to use CRFs as source documents.&nbsp;
      If this is the case, it should be stated in this section what data will be collected on CRFs and what
      data will be collected from other sources. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>It is not acceptable for the CRF to be the only record of a participant’s inclusion in the

      <p><em>Specify the length of time for the investigator to maintain all records pertaining to this study.
      &nbsp;The investigator should use the most conservative rule for document retention – i.e., retention
      should follow the rule that has the longest period.&nbsp; For NIH, grantees must retain records for a
      period of three years from the date of Federal Financial Report (FFR) submission. &nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Indicate whether permission is required (and from whom) prior to destruction of records. If

      <h3>10.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Informed Consent Process</h3>
      <h4>10.1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent/assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to participants</h4>
      <p>Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given
      to the participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting
      intervention/administering study intervention.&nbsp; The following consent materials are submitted
      with this protocol <span>[insert list]</span>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>10.1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent Procedures and Documentation</h4>
      <p>Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate
      in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will
      be Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved and the participant will be asked to read and review
      the document. The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any
      questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s
      comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as
      research participants.&nbsp; Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written
      consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss
      the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The
      participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically
      for the study. Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw
      from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given
      to the participants for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented
      in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any
      study-specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by emphasizing
      to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study Discontinuation and Closure</h3>
      <p>This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable
      cause.&nbsp; Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will
      be provided by the suspending or terminating party to <span>[study participants, investigator, funding
      agency, the Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) sponsor and
      regulatory authorities]</span>.&nbsp; If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal
      Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants, the IRB, and sponsor and will provide the
      reason(s) for the termination or suspension.&nbsp; Study participants will be contacted, as applicable,
      and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants</li>
      <li>Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements</li>
      <li>Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable</li>
      <li>Determination that the primary endpoint has been met</li>
      <li>Determination of futility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed,
      and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and/or Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidentiality and privacy</h3>
      <p>Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators,
      their staff, and the sponsor(s) and their interventions. This confidentiality is extended to cover
      testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to
      participants. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated
      will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released
      to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the Institutional
      Review Board (IRB), regulatory agencies or pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect
      all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to,
      medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study.
      The clinical study site will permit access to such records.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for
      internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure
      location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, Institutional policies, or sponsor requirements.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific
      reporting, will be transmitted to and stored at the <span>[specify name of Data Coordinating Center]</span>.
      This will not include the participant’s contact or identifying information. Rather, individual
      participants and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number.
      The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and by <span>[specify name
      of Data Coordinating Center]</span> research staff will be secured and password protected. At the
      end of the study, all study databases will be de-identified and archived at the <span>[specify
      name of Data Coordinating Center]</span>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Certificate of Confidentiality (if applicable)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be
      issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This certificate protects identifiable research
      information from forced disclosure. It allows the investigator and others who have access to research
      records to refuse to disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, criminal,
      administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level.
      By protecting researchers and institutions from being compelled to disclose information that would
      identify research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research objectives
      and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentiality and privacy to participants.</p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>10.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future Use of Stored Specimens and Data</h3>
      <p>Data collected for this study will be analyzed and stored at the <span>[specify name of Data
      Coordinating Center]</span>. After the study is completed, the de-identified, archived data will
      be transmitted to and stored at the <span>[specify name of Data Repository]</span>, for use by
      other researchers including those outside of the study. Permission to transmit data to the
      <span>[specify name of Data Repository]</span> will be included in the informed consent.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With the participant’s approval and as approved by local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs),
      de-identified biological samples will be stored at the <span>[specify name of Biosample Repository]</span>
      with the same goal as the sharing of data with the <span>[specify name of Data Repository]</span>.
      These samples could be used for research the causes of <span>[specify condition(s)]</span>, its
      complications and other conditions for which individuals with <span>[specify condition(s)]</span>
      are at increased risk, and to improve treatment. The <span>[specify name of Repository]</span>
      will also be provided with a code-link that will allow linking the biological specimens with the
      phenotypic data from each participant, maintaining the blinding of the identity of the participant.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to
      have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with regard
      to biosample storage may not be possible after the study is completed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the
      <span>[specify name of Repository]</span>.</p>

      Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP),
      Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents,
      and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and regulatory authorities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10.1.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Handling and Record Keeping</h3>
      <h4>10.1.9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Collection and Management Responsibilities</h4>
      <p>Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision
      of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness,
      legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hardcopies of the study visit worksheets will be provided for use as source document worksheets for
      recording data for each participant enrolled in the study.&nbsp; Data recorded in the electronic case
      report form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and
      clinical laboratory data will be entered into <span>[specify name of data capture system]</span>,
      a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data capture system provided by the <span>[specify DCC]</span>. The data
      system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks,
      to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered
      directly from the source documents.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>10.1.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study Records Retention</h4>
      <p>Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing
      application in an International Conference on Harminosation (ICH) region and until there are no
      pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have
      elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These
      documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records
      will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility
      of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10.1.10&nbsp; Protocol Deviations</h3>
      <p>A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference
      on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or MOP requirements. The noncompliance may be either
      on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations,
      corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3</li>
      <li>5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1</li>
      <li>5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and
      report deviations within <span>[specify number]</span> working days of identification of the protocol
      deviation, or within <span>[specify number]</span> working days of the scheduled protocol-required
      activity.&nbsp; All deviations must be addressed in study source documents, reported to
      <span>[specify NIH Institute or Center (IC)]</span> Program Official and <span>[specify Data Coordinating
      Center or sponsor]</span>.&nbsp; Protocol deviations must be sent to the reviewing IRB per their policies.
      The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements.
      Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10.1.11&nbsp; Publication and Data Sharing Policy</h3>
      <p>This study will be conducted in accordance with the following publication and data sharing policies and regulations:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has
      access to the published results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to submit final
      peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive
      <u>PubMed Central</u> upon acceptance for publication.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This study will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Policy on the Dissemination of NIH-Funded
      Clinical Trial Information and the Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information Submission rule.
      As such,&nbsp; this trial will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, and results information from this
      trial will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, every attempt will be made to publish
      results in peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp; Data from this study may be requested from other researchers
      x years after the completion of the primary endpoint by contacting <span>[specify person or awardee
      institution or name of data repository]</span>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In addition, this study will comply with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy, which applies to all
      NIH-funded research that generates large-scale human or non-human genomic data, as well as the use of
      these data for subsequent research. Large-scale data include genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays, and genome sequence, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and gene expression data.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10.1.12&nbsp; Conflict of Interest Policy</h3>
      <p>The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the pharmaceutical
      industry, is critical. Therefore any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design,
      conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore,
      persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in
      a way that is appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct of this trial.&nbsp; The
      study leadership in conjunction with the <span>[specify NIH Institute or Center (IC)]</span> has
      established policies and procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest
      and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.</p>
