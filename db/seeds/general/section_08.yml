      <p><em>The following subsections are intended to highlight the specific assessments related to
      safety and the aspects of the study which are proposed to ensure the safety of trial participants.&nbsp;
      Consider developing this section in consultation with the study Medical Monitor.&nbsp; Consider the
      risks of the study intervention and other study procedures and the characteristics of the study
      population (e.g., vulnerable populations such as children).&nbsp; This section should be tailored
      for specific study characteristics, including but not limited to the following:</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>The study involves an investigational new drug or investigational device</em></li>
      <li><em>The study involves washout from current medication regimen</em></li>
      <li><em>The study involves the use of placebo in a population with a diagnosed disease</em></li>
      <li><em>The study requires selection of an appropriate toxicity grading scale </em></li>
      <li><em>The study involves risks to individuals other than research participants (e.g., household
      or intimate contacts or communities, study clinicians, pharmacists or interventionists, etc.)</em></li>
      <li><em>Reporting of certain events (e.g., suspected child abuse or substance abuse) is mandatory
      because of the study population or study design characteristics</em></li>
      <li><em>The study is conducted at multiple sites, and will require centralized safety oversight</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>In developing this section, consider the risks of the study intervention. Review and reference
      the applicable sources of information, such as the IB, package insert, device labeling, literature
      and other sources that describe the study intervention.&nbsp; </em></p>

      <h3>8.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Adverse Events (AE)</h3>
      <p><em>Provide the definition of an AE being used for the clinical trial.&nbsp; The FDA definition
      of an AE is used in this template since this template is for phase 2 or 3 IND and IDE studies.
      For some studies, definitions from the OHRP Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems
      Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events; or ICH GCP definition may be more appropriate.&nbsp;
      However, it is important to note that FDA regulations require reporting based on the definition included
      in 21 CFR 312.32 (a) for studies performed under an IND, regardless of the definition of AE used in the protocol.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</h3>
      <p><em>Provide the definition of an SAE being used for the clinical trial. The FDA definition of
      an SAE is used in this template since this template is for phase 2 or 3 IND and IDE studies.&nbsp;
      It is important to note that FDA regulations require reporting based on the definition included
      in 21 CFR 312.32 (a) for studies performed under an IND, regardless of the definition of SAE used
      in the protocol.&nbsp; Note that the example text provided is from the drug regulations (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).&nbsp;
      There is no definition for SAE in the device regulations.&nbsp; Therefore, investigators should
      develop an appropriate definition for their study. This definition could include an unanticipated
      adverse device effect, but an SAE is broader than that definition.&nbsp; According to 21 CFR 812.3(s),
      an “unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or
      any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem,
      or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational
      plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious
      problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classification of an Adverse Event</h3>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>No text is to be entered in this section; rather it should be included under the relevant subheadings below.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>The following subsections will include a discussion of how AEs will be classified.</em></p>
      <h4>8.3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severity of Event</h4>
      <p><em>All AEs will be assessed by the study clinician using a protocol defined grading system.&nbsp;
      Describe the method of grading an AE for severity. For example, many toxicity tables are available for
      use and are adaptable to various study designs. Selection of a toxicity table or severity scale should
      be made in consultation with the study Medical Monitor.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>8.3.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship to Study INTERVENTION</h4>
      <p><em>All AEs will have their relationship to study intervention or study participation assessed
      with a level of specificity appropriate to the study design. The clinician’s assessment of an AE's
      relationship to study intervention (drug, biologic, device) is part of the documentation process,
      but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. Describe the method
      of determining the relationship of an AE to a study intervention. If there is any doubt as to whether
      a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.&nbsp; Some protocols may use a binary
      assessment (related/not related); others may have a scale of relatedness.&nbsp; Evaluation of relatedness
      must consider etiologies such as natural history of the underlying disease, concurrent illness, concomitant
      therapy, study-related procedures, accidents, and other external factors. &nbsp;In a clinical trial,
      the study intervention must always be suspect. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>8.3.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expectedness</h4>
      <p><em>Expected adverse reactions are AEs that are known to occur for the study intervention being
      studied and should be collected in a standard, systematic format using a grading scale based on
      functional assessment or magnitude of reaction. Identify the source of the reference safety information
      used to</em><em> determine the expectedness of the AE (e.g., IB, approved labeling). Expectedness
      is assessed based on the awareness of AEs previously observed, not on the basis of what might be
      anticipated from the properties of the study intervention. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the IB,
      package insert, or device labeling or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed;
      or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the
      protocol, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue
      of greater severity) if the IB or package insert referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
      Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater
      specificity) if the IB or package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used
      in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB,
      package insert, or device labeling as occurring with a class of drugs (or other medical products) or as
      anticipated from the pharmacological properties or other characteristics of the study intervention, but
      are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular study intervention under investigation.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>8.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up</h3>
      <p><em>Describe how AEs and SAEs will be identified and followed until resolved or considered stable.&nbsp;
      Specify procedures for recording and follow-up of AEs and SAEs that are consistent with the information
      contained within <strong>Section 8.2, Safety and Other Assessments</strong> including what assessment
      tools will be used to monitor AEs.&nbsp; Include duration of follow-up after appearance of events
      (e.g., 1 week, 2 months).</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>An unsolicited AE would occur without any prompting or in response to a general question
      such as “Have you noticed anything different since you started the study; began the study intervention,
      etc.” A solicited AE is one that is specifically solicited such as “Have you noticed any dry
      mouth since you started the study medication?”</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>Describe which AEs will be collected as solicited events. Plan the reporting and data
      collection system to avoid double capture (captured both as an unsolicited and a solicited AE).</em></li>
      <li><em>Describe how unsolicited events will be captured.</em></li>
      <li><em>Include time period of collection (e.g., Days 0 -28) and note how long SAEs are collected – usually
      collected through entire study.</em>&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adverse Event Reporting</h3>
      <p><em>This section addresses responsibilities of investigators for reporting of AEs.&nbsp; However,
      it is important to recognize that sponsors have additional responsibilities under regulations that
      are not described in this template and should be incorporated into relevant SOPs.&nbsp; </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Describe the AE reporting procedures, including timeframes.&nbsp; Further details should be
      included in a MOP or SOP including a description and a flow chart of when events are reported to
      various oversight (e.g., Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), safety monitoring committee, independent
      safety monitor) and regulatory groups, and what study staff are responsible for completing and signing
      off on the AE reports, and who will receive notification of AEs.&nbsp; According to 21 CFR 312.64(b),
      “…The investigator must record nonserious adverse events and report them to the sponsor according to
      the timetable for reporting specified in the protocol”.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>In addition, list any disease-related events (DREs) common in the study population (e.g., expected),
      which will not be reported per the standard process for reporting, as applicable. Describe how these events
      will be recorded and monitored.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious Adverse Event Reporting</h3>
      <p><em>This section addresses responsibilities of investigators for reporting of SAEs.&nbsp; However,
      it is important to recognize that sponsors have additional responsibilities under regulations that
      are not described in this template and should be incorporated into relevant SOPs.&nbsp; </em></p>

      reports, and who will receive notification of SAEs. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Generally, any AE considered serious by the PI or Sub-investigator or which meets the definition
      of an SAE included in <strong>Section 8.3.2, Definition of Serious Adverse Events </strong>must be
      submitted on an SAE form to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) if one exists for the study.&nbsp;
      Studies overseen by a DSMB or other independent oversight body (e.g., safety monitoring committee,
      independent safety monitor), may be required to submit expedited notification of all SAEs or only
      SAEs thought to be related to study intervention.&nbsp; </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>According to 21 CFR 312.64(b), “An investigator must immediately report to the sponsor any
      serious adverse event, whether or not considered drug related, including those listed in the protocol
      or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility
      that the drug caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality)
      must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship
      between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must

    example: |-
      <h3>8.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Adverse Events (AE)</h3>
      <p>Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention
      in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).</p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</h3>
      <p>An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of
      either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening
      adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or
      significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or
      a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening,
      or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment,
      they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one
      of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm
      requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that
      do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.</p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classification of an Adverse Event</h3>
      <h4>8.3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severity of Event</h4>
      <p>For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following
      guidelines will be used to describe severity.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Mild </strong>– Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the
      participant’s daily activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate </strong>– Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the
      therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.</li>
      <li><strong>Severe </strong>– Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require
      systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or
      incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>8.3.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship to Study INTERVENTION</h4>
      <p>All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the
      clinician who examines and evaluates the participant based on temporal relationship and his/her
      clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.
      In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Related</strong> – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a
      reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship
      between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to
      suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Related</strong> – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration
      of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study
      intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>OR</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Definitely Related </strong>– There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship,
      and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal
      laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration
      and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal
      of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically
      or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Probably Related </strong>– There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the
      influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test
      result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely
      to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable
      response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.</li>
      <li><strong>Potentially Related </strong>– There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship
      (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication).
      However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition,
      other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery,
      it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or
      “definitely related”, as appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlikely to be related </strong>– A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory
      test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship
      improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study
      intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations
      (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).</li>
      <li><strong>Not Related </strong>– The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration,
      and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an
      alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>8.3.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expectedness</h4>
      <p><span>[Insert role]</span> will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE)
      is expected or unexpected.&nbsp; An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency
      of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>8.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up</h3>
      <p>The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention
      of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical
      care, or upon review by a study monitor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured
      on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description,
      time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by
      those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of
      the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.
      All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be
      considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition
      deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of
      the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require
      documentation of onset and duration of each episode.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span>[Insert role or name]</span> will record all reportable events with start dates occurring
      any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after
      the last day of study participation.&nbsp; At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about
      the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.&nbsp; Events will be followed for outcome information
      until resolution or stabilization.</p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h3>8.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adverse Event Reporting</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>8.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious Adverse Event Reporting</h3>
      <p><em>Example 1, applicable for a drug or biologic protocol:</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>The study clinician will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether
      or not considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or investigator
      brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study
      intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality)
      must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship
      between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the
      investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the
      site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting
      documentation of the event may be requested by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/study sponsor
      and should be provided as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of
      any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no
      case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  In addition,
      the sponsor must notify FDA and all participating investigators in an Investigational New Drug (IND)
      safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible,
      but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.</p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>OR </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Example 2, applicable for device protocol:</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>The study investigator shall complete an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Form and submit
      to the study sponsor and to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) as soon as possible,
      but in no event later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.  The
      study sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of an unanticipated adverse device effect
      and shall report the results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to all
      reviewing IRBs and participating investigators within 10 working days after the sponsor first receives
      notice of the effect. Thereafter, the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests.</p>

      <strong><u>all</u></strong> of the following criteria:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are

      <li>Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including
      physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>Additional example text, applicable for device protocols:</p>

      <h3>8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unanticipated Problem Reporting</h3>
      <p>The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review
      Board (IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report
      will include the following information:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;</li>
      <li>A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;</li>
      <li>An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP;</li>

      or are proposed in response to the UP.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor

      <p>An investigator shall submit to the sponsor and to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB)
      a report of any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as
      possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect
      (21 CFR 812.150(a)(1)), A sponsor who conducts an evaluation of an unanticipated adverse device effect
      under 812.46(b) shall report the results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      and to all reviewing IRB's and participating investigators within 10 working days after the sponsor
