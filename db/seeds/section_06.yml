      to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that is intended for administration to
      humans or use in humans, and that has been or has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA). This also includes a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or
      packaged) in a way different from the approved form, when used for an unapproved indication or when
      used to gain further information about an approved use.</em></p>

      <p><em>Describe the procedures for selecting each participant's dose of study intervention and control
      product.&nbsp; For drugs, that includes the timing of dosing (e.g., time of day, interval), the duration
      (e.g., the length of time study participants will be administered the study intervention), the planned
      route of administration (e.g., oral, nasal, intramuscular), and the relation of dosing to meals.&nbsp; </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>State the starting dose and schedule of the study intervention and control product, including
      the maximum and minimum duration for those participants who continue in the study.</em> <em>For example,
      in some oncology trials for participants with no available therapeutic alternatives, intervention continues
      even after disease progression. In this instance, consider alternative designs that enable participants to
      rollover to a continued treatment arm and include appropriate instructions to guide this implementation.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>If applicable, describe the dose escalation scheme and dose regimen (using exact dose, rather
      than percentages). State any minimum period required before a participant’s dose might be raised to
      the next higher dose or dose range.&nbsp; If applicable, the protocol should state the conditions under
      which a dose change will be made, particularly in regard to failure to respond or to toxic or untoward
      changes in stipulated indicators (e.g., white blood cell count in cancer chemotherapy).&nbsp; Address
      dose modifications for specific abnormal laboratory values of concern or other adverse events (AEs)
      that are known to be associated with the planned study intervention.&nbsp; The protocol must state
      explicitly the dose-limiting effects that are anticipated.&nbsp; Provide criteria that will be used
      to determine dose escalations.&nbsp; If a participant is responding positively to the intervention,
      the protocol should specify whether study intervention administration would progress to still higher
      doses.&nbsp; If appropriate, provide a dose de-escalation schema with intervention modifications.&nbsp;
      Do not restate reasons for withdrawal of participants.&nbsp; Cross-reference relevant sections, as appropriate.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Any specific instructions to study participants about when or how to prepare and take the dose(s)
      should be described, including how delayed or missed doses should be handled.&nbsp; Include any specific
      instructions or safety precautions for administration of the study intervention.&nbsp; Discuss the
      maximum hold time once thawed/mixed, if appropriate, before administration.</em></p>
      <p><em>While much of the above section is specific to drugs, similar considerations apply to certain
      devices. For example, some devices have adjustable settings including those related to energy delivery
      to participants. Other devices must be sized correctly for individual participants. Similar to the
      discussion above for dosage of drugs, such considerations should be described for devices, as applicable. </em></p>

      <p><em>This section should contain a description of randomization and blinding procedures (if applicable
      to the study design).&nbsp; It should include a description or a table that describes how study participants
      will be assigned to study groups, without being so specific that blinding or randomization might be
      compromised (e.g., the ratio between intervention and placebo groups may be stated).&nbsp; If adaptive
      randomization or other methods of covariate balancing/minimization are employed, include a cross link
      to the methods of analysis in <strong>Section 9, Statistical Considerations</strong>. In addition, details
      regarding the implementation of procedures to minimize bias should be included in this section. DO NOT
      include details that might compromise these strategies. Design techniques to avoid bias can be found in
      the ICH Guidance for Industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials.</em></p>

      <p><em>Plans for the maintenance of trial randomization codes and appropriate blinding for the study
      should be discussed. The timing and procedures for planned and unplanned breaking of randomization
      codes should be included.&nbsp; Include a statement regarding when unblinding may occur and who may
      unblind. Provide the criteria for breaking the study blind or participant code.&nbsp; Discuss the
      circumstances in which the blind would be broken for an individual or for all participants (e.g.,
      for serious adverse evets (SAEs)). Indicate to whom the intentional and unintentional breaking of
      the blind should be reported. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Sometimes blinding is attempted but is known to be imperfect because of obvious effects
      related to study intervention or control product in some participants (e.g., dry mouth, bradycardia,
      fever, injection site reactions, and changes in laboratory data). Such problems or potential problems
      should be identified and, if there are plans to assess the magnitude of the problem or manage it,
      these should be described (e.g., having endpoint measurements carried out by study staff shielded
      from information that might reveal study group assignment).</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>If the study allows for some investigators to remain unblinded (e.g., to allow them to adjust
      medication), the means of shielding other investigators should be explained. Describe efforts to
      ensure that the study intervention and control/placebo are as indistinguishable as possible. Measures
      to prevent unblinding by laboratory measurements, if used, should be described.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Include a description of your plans to manage and report inadvertent unblinding.&nbsp; </em>
      <em>If blinding is considered unnecessary to reduce bias for some or all of the observations, this
      should be explained (e.g., use of a random-zero sphygmomanometer eliminates possible observer bias
      in reading blood pressure and Holter tapes are often read by automated systems that are presumably
      immune to observer bias). If blinding is considered desirable but not feasible, the reasons and
      implications should be discussed.</em></p>
