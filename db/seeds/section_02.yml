      <p><em>Include a discussion of known potential risks from either clinical or nonclinical studies.&nbsp;
      If a package insert or device labeling from a licensed or approved product is available, it should
      be used as the primary source of risk information. If the product is investigational, the IB should
      be the primary source of the risk information. In addition, relevant published literature can also
      provide relevant risk information. If the risk profile cannot be described from the package insert,
      device labeling, or the IB, the risk information discussion will result from published literature
      and should be included and referenced appropriately. </em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>Describe any physical, psychological, social, legal, economic, or any other risks to participants

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>Immediate risks </em></li>
      <li><em>Long-range risks </em></li>

      If a package insert or device labeling from a licensed or approved product is available, it should
      be used as the primary source of potential benefit information. If the product is investigational,
      the IB should be the primary source of the potential benefit information. In addition, relevant published
      literature can also provide potential relevant benefit information. If the potential benefit cannot
      be described from the package insert, device labeling, or the IB, the potential benefit information
      discussion will result from published literature and should be included and referenced appropriately.</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Describe any physical, psychological, social, legal, or any other potential benefits to individual

      <li><em>Rationale for the necessity of exposing participants to risks and a summary of the ways
      that risks to participants were minimized in the study design</em></li>
      <li><em>Justification as to why the risks of participation in the study outweigh the value of
